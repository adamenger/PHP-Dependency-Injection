These are few simple CRUD tests I created for learning how to use Dependency Injection. 


1. Create database called 'blog'


2. Change values of username, password inside of Class Blog located in blog.php


3. import blog.sql file 
	> mysql -h localhost -u root -p < blog.sql

4. open index.php in web browser
